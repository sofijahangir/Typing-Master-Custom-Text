                Hashtag Nationalism
                <footer><i><strong>Twitter, like most of India, has recently seen a flurry of proclamations and professions of nationalism.
                            The most surprising of these come from Kashmir – subject to over 100 days of curfew since July – and are
                            beautifully captured by the #kashmirlovesindia hashtag.

                            The innocuous Twitter accounts weaving this narrative, 140 characters at a time, have pictures of young women
                            with generic Muslim first names and inventive last names, often Khan and Kashmiri. In many of these assertions,
                            there is vehement condemnation for terrorism and Pakistan strewn into the same sentence while photos in jarring
                            neon mention how “every Kashmiri loves India”. Heartwarming as it is to hear such loyalty for the nation and
                            disaffection for Pakistan, how close are these assertions to the truth?

                            The map of India, with Kashmir as its crowning glory, has had the persuasive capacity to structure the national
                            imagination as one in which Kashmir is seen as an integral part of the Indian mainland. As many have pointed
                            out, this imagination often excludes Kashmiris themselves. Voices from within are often heard, yet seldom
                            listened to. When slogans of azadi ring across the Valley, the people are termed ungrateful.

                            But what many Indians fail to recognise or even accept is the reflexive disposition of Kashmiris to resist the
                            nation. Kashmiris embody this disposition from early adolescence. Even those who do not actively participate in
                            the Kashmiri resistance movement verbalise hostility towards the Indian nation in speech and acts. They do not
                            take to arms or to the streets to protest, but collude ideologically and resist passively. They may not be the
                            voices ringing out on the streets, but they shape the discourse through living room conversations.

                            Modes of passive resistance and disguised ideological insubordination operate differently and can be
                            distinguished from the stone pelting and slogan chanting of the streets.

                            Many in Kashmir are – or seek to be – employed by the Indian state, yet can be found in private spaces acting in
                            ways or holding beliefs that could potentially be termed seditious. They typically express their opinion openly,
                            yet it is disguised. The active protesting of recent years was not always necessary to lift the veil of
                            quiescence. When former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah publicly claimed that anti-India
                            slogans were normal in Kashmir earlier this year, it came as a surprise to the rest of the country. However, for
                            any one growing up in Kashmir, the anti-India sentiment is a popularly acknowledged one.

                            Everyday resistance
                            In a recent interview, soldiers employed by the state government described their condition as “aazad Hindustan
                            ke gulaam sipaahi” – enslaved soldiers of an Independent India. This view is common and is also present among
                            children. For instance, at flag-hoisting ceremonies in Kashmir’s schools, even in those run by the Indian Army,
                            many Kashmiri students intentionally disrespect the tricolour. There are rules to hoist the flag, and students
                            usually ignore these rules as the urge for insubordination runs deep in their minds.

                            Similar incidents are noted during the singing of the Indian national anthem. One is expected to stand still in
                            reverence while it plays. But students in schools all across the Valley find glee in fidgeting during a
                            rendition.

                            A few months ago, an incident at a school in Srinagar made news when a guest asked its students if India
                            deserved a permanent seat in the United Nation. The students disagreed, leaving him surprised and school
                            authorities embarrassed.

                            Similarly, Indian national holidays – Independence Day and Republic Day – are symbolically marked as black days.

                            Kashmiris use cricket as another avenue for everyday, symbolic resistance against the Indian state. Hostility
                            against India is especially high during a cricket match. The pointed support of Kashmiris for whichever team
                            plays against India provides a much needed, active space for resistance. It is common to hear that if India
                            played Israel in any sport, Kashmiris would support Israel. This is a bold assertion in light of the solidarity
                            the Valley feels for Palestine.

                            These acts reflect the widespread belief that historically, Kashmir’s accession to India was not legitimate, and
                            on reports of human rights violations, which together have made Kashmiris even more resentful towards the
                            nation. This discourse needs to be heard, accepted and then dealt with.

                            Online activism
                            The growth of smartphones and social media has now created a vast online space for digital activism, and
                            provided an outlet for resistance online. There are often government restrictions on telecommunications and gags
                            on the local media, making the internet an important platform for engaging in political discourse. Mobile
                            internet was restricted recently for the same reason. Nevertheless, tech-savvy activists have taken to the
                            internet, using WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and blogs to have discussions and spread their messages. Attempting
                            to mask this dissent by threatening such activists or creating fake accounts to cover up the shame of so-called
                            anti-nationalism on these platforms is far from the solution.

                            If history is anything to go by, the deadlock will continue. Many Kashmiris resent the separatists, especially
                            given the economic shutdown of the past three months, but to suggest that Kashmiris love India is also false, to
                            say the least.

                            To understand the full picture, it is essential for Indians to look beyond the five people they speak to in the
                            tourist towns of Gulmarg and Pahalgam and the security personnel they see during visits to the Valley. Engage
                            and converse with people who live the reality that is Kashmir. Pressing the heart button on tweets that align
                            with one’s beliefs is not enough. Empathise. Living under the constant gaze of the much disliked other is not
                            always pleasant.
