                Love in the time of Curfew
                <footer><i><strong> Yet again, Kashmir is under unrest. Since July 2016, this has been an ongoing affair, constantly
                            redefining the normal. Not only the recent spate of violence since July but also the increasing spirit of
                            resistance over the last couple of years and the rising presence of religion over the last decade has had an
                            impact on the social space. I often wondered how this affects interactions of a romantic nature. Little is
                            written about social life in Kashmir and since marriage and courtship takes up much time and cognitive space, I
                            unpack how it works in Kashmir.

                            Romance in and around Srinagar has come a long way from images I remember from ten years ago; seeing pubescent
                            boys’ bobbing heads over the wall of girls’ schools, groups of boys following girls home and a lone teenager
                            waiting in the streets to catch a glimpse of the girl he likes. The Internet has had a huge role to play in it.
                            It has been a catalyst for relationships, as it has for activism in the valley. The Internet ban has thus had
                            its consequences on this too.

                            Traditional Match-Making in Kashmir

                            Like most of South Asia, marriage continues to be extremely important and is seen as a transition into adulthood
                            in Kashmir. In Kashmir, marriages are arranged very systematically. The manzimyors or the traditional
                            matchmakers have for long gone from home to home, bringing with them a roster of eligible young men and women on
                            the market; their diaries loaded with details. Manzimyors can be men or women, but since they occupy feminine
                            spaces within the household, the male manzimyors go to great lengths to act more effeminate to fit in. While
                            their criteria for matchmaking and suitability don’t quite match up to algorithms dating apps offer, they look
                            for essentials; age, khaandaan (family), ponsa (wealth) and shakal (looks) and are still are responsible for
                            most of the matchmaking in Srinagar.

                            The curfew, though, does not seem to have had much of an impact on them. I spoke to manzimyor who had been in
                            operation since the 1980s and he has had no problems since he got himself a cellphone. Most conversations now
                            happen on the phone, he says and boys and girls too speak to each other through phone calls and it all seems to
                            work out. Unlike the early 90s, working around the curfews is much easier. They also manage to earn a little
                            more convincing their hosts of how dangerous it is to come out and visit in times of unrest. His business is
                            going well, he says; although there are many that choose to marry on their own now.

                            While the unrest does not seem to be taking a toll on matchmakers, it does have an impact on the weddings many
                            of which had been cancelled, postponed and hastily conducted in the last year. Angry neighbors interrupted
                            celebrations thinking that those celebrating were disrespecting the cause. Most weddings after were low-key and
                            did away with the weeklong fanfare and some even did away with the famed 32-course wazawan meal. The curfew
                            maharaza (groom) and mahrin (bride), in the spirit of Kashmiri jest, will be remembered with these names for a
                            while.

                            Single Sex Education and Tuition Centers

                            Starting middle school, you see a surge in the popularity of private tuitions in Srinagar. As a business model,
                            they are lucrative. Young students all across the city attend classes starting from dawn up until late in the
                            evening. Little of their popularity has to do with a poor school education. Most education in Srinagar tends to
                            be single sex and tuitions are the only place where teenagers can intermingle.

                            However, mixing of the sexes is not overt there either. Boys and girls split sides while sitting in classrooms.
                            Speaking to a young girl who studied in one of the few co-educational schools in Srinagar, she finds the
                            atmosphere of her college in Srinagar stifling. She finds it tough to speak to male classmates like she did back
                            at school because many of them are not used to speaking to girls at all. It is almost a taboo to be seen walking
                            around or talking to boys because people notice and people talk she says. How then, I asked, do people meet?
                            Girls and boys usually see each other somewhere, often tuitions and schools, and start talking over the phone.
                            In some cases are introduced through friends.

                            On the surface, public intermingling of the sexes is rare and frowned upon. The ones who can afford it go to
                            restaurants, and the ones who cannot find space in the parks and gardens, often risking morally policed by
                            self-proclaimed activists. With the curfew, mobility is further restricted. Given the conservative sentiment of
                            the city, it is not openly talked about or approved either. Most of the romance in Srinagar, thus, happens on
                            the Internet and over the phone. This breeds a repression and an underbelly fuelling unsafe cyber practices that
                            very often run haywire; stalkers, cyber bullying and harassment are common and create a malicious web especially
                            for young girls.

                            The sentiment of unhealthy stalking has its roots in much of how many romances begin; obsessive proclamations of
                            love are seen as the way to woo girls. Many express their concerns this seeming norm; boy spots the girl,
                            follows her, and coaxes her until she agrees to date him. Most girls admitted to having been victims of such
                            behavior but never reported it for fear of causing a scene. Others naively enter into associations they soon
                            regret; immediately after they have fake profiles created by jilted lovers, private photos leaked and emails
                            hacked. Only then do they resort to contacting the police.

                            The Internet and Dating

                            I started looking this up to find how the social media ban impacts relationships I found what I didn’t expect.
                            While it does prevent many people from keeping in touch with their close families, people adapt. The Internet
                            ban is not new to Kashmir. People are used to it and have found other ways, phone calls and Wi-Fi still work and
                            then there is VPN. A casual question I asked not expecting to find much led me to stumble upon my most
                            interesting find here; the prevalence of online dating. By no means is this widespread but an increasingly large
                            number of boys and girls (often not with their real identities) use popular dating apps. Many say it is because
                            of the free time they have at their hands with not much to do and little other interaction with their peer group
                            at home.

                            The young boys I spoke to have an entourage of girls they are dating, few from Kashmir but largely from other
                            states in India whom they meet when they travel. Quite a few date internationally. Boys I spoke to in Srinagar
                            colleges have been dating girls from all over; East Asians to Arabs and some closer but across the border,
                            Pakistanis. For girls however, it is not the same. The of being and shamed is higher so many use apps with fake
                            names and fake accounts. Many girls on dating apps often tend to be men looking for a good laugh. Online dating
                            apps are also extremely empowering to the small group of LGBT youngsters in the valley. Though none that I tried
                            to discuss it with spoke of it, dating apps say otherwise.

                            The rise of religion and religious markers also tells a different story if unpacked. Much of what looks like
                            religiosity from the outside has many layered causes. Markers like the rise of the hijab and burqa for women are
                            usually seen as a direct result of what is said to be extremist Islam purported in the valley. Many young girls,
                            however, admit to taking to it for the anonymity it brings. Ease in dating and going out without fear of being
                            told on, or the fear of being seen as immoral makes wearing a garb that hides their identity appealing.

                            The social space in Srinagar is complex and only ever really understood if you make an effort to investigate.
                            Speculations can run rife but things are not always, as they seem. Different cultures breed different contexts,
                            and Kashmir, as many youngsters I spoke to said, is very different from the rest of India.</strong></i></footer>
